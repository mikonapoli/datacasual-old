    "The quick answer is that it is almost always a good idea to use the median rather than the mean, as it is way more robust to outliers (for a more detailed explanation you can check, for example, [this post](https://creativemaths.net/blog/median/)). The reason why we tend to use the mean is that it is mathematically well behaved and efficient to compute, but nowadays we can get around that with brute computational power and get something which is more robust. \n",
    "\n",
    "The main exception to this rule is when you have very small samples, especially if you are measuring integers. The reason being that in this situation the median can jump around quite a bit. Let's run a small experiment. Here is a population of 20,000 integeres normally distributed (with standard deviation 20) around a mean of 100."

    "Another problem of the approach we have used so far is that the authors are (presumably) comparing the average viral loads of the same group with and without the masks. This (i.e. evaluating the differences of the averages) is the same as considering the test and control groups as independent, which is certainly not the case here as it's the same patients being used as test and control groups. A more appropriate idea is to instead consider the differences with and without the masks for each patient independently and then averaging those differences. *In other words, it is better to compute the mean of the differences rather than the difference of the mean*. This is particularly important when there is a lot of variance in your test population. It is hard to tell in this case, but looking at the characteristic of the patients, they are far from a homogeneous group. Furthermore, there is really no reason not to use the appropriate test, so let's see what happens."

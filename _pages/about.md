Hi there, I am Miko.

I am European, originally from Italy, currently residing in the UK after a decade or so of roaming around the continent.

I am a mathematician, turned to the dark side of of the "real world" with a few fruitless postdocs under my belt.

After a winding path that saw me being an intern, a knowledge/sales engineer, a product manager, I ended up in data science, learning a thing or two in the process.

Hi there, I am Miko, I'm an accidental data scientist and I learn things, because I like it and because I must.

Welcome to my site.
